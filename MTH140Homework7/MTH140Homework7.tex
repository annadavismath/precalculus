 For this assignment, please use GeoGebra for your critical $t$ values and keep all four digits in your intermediate computations.  Round as indicated in each problem.
 
 \begin{problem}\label{prob:140hom7prob3}
 Find the critical $t$ value for each of the following scenarios.

\geogebra{emwxhga2}{800}{600}  
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $CL=0.98, n=102$
    $$t_{\alpha/2}=\answer{2.3638}$$
    \item $CL=0.8, n=128$
    $$t_{\alpha/2}=\answer{1.2883}$$
    \item $CL=0.95, n=44$
    $$t_{\alpha/2}=\answer{2.0167}$$
\end{enumerate}
 \end{problem}
 
 \begin{problem}\label{prob:140hom7prob1}
 A customer survey measured customer satisfaction with their dining experience on a scale from 1 (not satisfied) to 5 (very satisfied).  The survey was administered to 47 randomly selected customers.  The sample had a mean of 4.4 and standard deviation of 0.35.  
 
 Summarize the given information:
 $$n=\answer{47},\quad\overline{x}=\answer{4.4},\quad s=\answer{0.35},\quad df=\answer{46}$$
 
 Construct a 90\% confidence interval for the mean satisfaction rating.
 
  Use GeoGebra to find the the critical $t$-value. 
 \begin{center}  
\geogebra{emwxhga2}{800}{600}  
\end{center}
$$t_{\alpha/2}=\answer{1.6787}$$
Error Bound for the Mean:
$$EBM=\answer{1.6787}\frac{\answer{0.35}}{\sqrt{\answer{47}}}=\answer{0.086}$$
(Keep all significant digits in your calculator as you are doing the problem.  Round your answer to 3 decimal places.)

The 90\% confidence interval is:
$$(\answer{4.314},\answer{4.486})$$
 
 \end{problem}
 
 \begin{problem}\label{prob:140hom7prob2}
 The following is a random sample of gas prices from 8 gas stations on the north-east side of Columbus. (October 11, 2020)
 $$1.95, 1.92, 1.99, 1.81, 1.86, 1.97, 1.99, 1.85$$
 Find the sample mean, sample standard deviation and degrees of freedom.  Round non-integer values to three decimal places.
 $$\overline{x}=\answer{1.918},\quad s=\answer{0.069},\quad df=\answer{7}$$
 
 Suppose that gas prices are approximately normally distributed.  Construct a 95\% confidence interval for the mean price of gasoline on the north-east side.
 
 Use GeoGebra to find the the critical $t$-value. 
 \begin{center}  
\geogebra{emwxhga2}{800}{600}  
\end{center}
$$t_{\alpha/2}=\answer{2.3646}$$
Error Bound for the Mean:
$$EBM=\answer{2.3646}\frac{\answer{0.069}}{\sqrt{\answer{8}}}=\answer{0.058}$$
(Keep all significant digits in your calculator as you are doing the problem.  Round your answer to 3 decimal places.)

The 95\% confidence interval is:
$$(\answer{1.86},\answer{1.976})$$
\end{problem}
