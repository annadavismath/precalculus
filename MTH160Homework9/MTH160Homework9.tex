  \begin{problem}\label{prob:160hom9prob1} 
Suppose \$3000 is deposited into an account which pays 2.5\% annual interest compounded daily.  
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item Fill in the given information:
 $$P=\$\answer{3000},\quad r=\answer{0.025},\quad n=\answer{365}$$
 \item How long will it take for the investment to grow to \$3500?
 Round your answer to one decimal place.
 $$t=\answer[tolerance=0.1]{6.2}$$
 \end{enumerate}
 \end{problem}
 
 \begin{problem}\label{prob:160hom9prob2} 
 Suppose a radioactive isotope decays according to the formula $A(t)=Pe^{-0.032t}$, where $t$ is measured in hours.  
 \begin{enumerate}
     \item 
If we start with 200 grams of the isotope, the amount left after 2 hours is: $\answer[tolerance=0.01]{187.6}$ grams.
\item The half-life of the isotope is: $\answer[tolerance=0.1]{21.66}$ hours.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}\label{prob:160hom9prob3}
 Suppose that the temperature of a pie taken out of the oven can be modeled by $T(t)=70+280e^{-0.7t}$, where $t$ is measured in hours.
 \begin{enumerate}
     \item The pie was baked at the temperature of $\answer{350}$ degrees.
     \item How long will it take for the pie to cool to 90 degrees?  Round your answers to two decimal places.
     $$t=\answer[tolerance=0.1]{3.77}$$
 \end{enumerate}
