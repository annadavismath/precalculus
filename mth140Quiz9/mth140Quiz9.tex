\begin{problem}\label{prob:140quiz9prob1}
Suppose exam scores are normally distributed with an unknown population mean and a population standard deviation of 10 points. A random sample of 120 scores is taken and gives a sample mean of 72. Follow the indicated steps to find a 98\% confidence interval for the true (population) mean of exam scores.

Summary of given info:
$$\sigma=\answer{10}$$
$$\overline{x}=\answer{72}$$
$$n=\answer{120}$$
Use the Critical $z$-value table in your lecture notes to find $z_{\alpha/2}$
$$z_{\alpha/2}=\answer{2.33}$$
Error Bound for the Mean:
$$EBM=\answer{2.33}\frac{\answer{10}}{\answer[tolerance=0.01]{\sqrt{120}}}=\answer[tolerance=0.01]{2.127}$$
The 98\% confidence interval is:
$$(\answer[tolerance=0.01]{69.873},\answer[tolerance=0.01]{74.127})$$

\begin{problem}\label{prob:140quiz9prob2}
Suppose a random sample of 6 gas stations in Columbus on March 29, 2020 yielded the following gas prices:

$$1.89,\quad 1.89,\quad 1.75,\quad 1.85,\quad 1.79,\quad 1.88$$

Assume that Columbus gas prices are approximately normally distributed.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the sample mean.
    $$\overline{x}=\answer[tolerance=0.001]{1.84}$$
    \item Use Excel (or Google Sheets) to find sample standard deviation.
    $$s=\answer[tolerance=0.001]{0.0588}$$
   \item Use the indicated steps to find a 90\% confidence interval for the mean gas price in Columbus. 
   
   Sample size:
   $$n=\answer{6}$$
   Degrees of freedom:
   $$df=\answer{5}$$
   Critical $t$ value:
   $$t=\answer{2.015}$$
   Error Bound for the Mean:
   $$EBM=\answer{2.015}\frac{\answer[tolerance=0.001]{0.0588}}{\answer[tolerance=0.01]{\sqrt{6}}}=\answer[tolerance=0.001]{0.0484}$$
   The 90\% confidence interval is:
$$(\answer[tolerance=0.01]{1.79},\answer[tolerance=0.01]{1.89})$$
\end{enumerate}
