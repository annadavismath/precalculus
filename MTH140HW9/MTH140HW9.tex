 \begin{problem}\label{prob:140hom9prob4}
Caleb wants to improve his long-jump.  His current mean length for the jump is 6.5 meters with a standard deviation of 0.35 meters.  Caleb adopts a new training routine.  To show that the new training routine was effective in increasing the length of his jumps, he measures 12 jumps. He finds that the average for the 12 jumps is 6.6 meters.  Assume normal distribution for jump lengths.  Conduct a hypothesis test using a 0.05 level of significance to determine if the training routine improved Caleb's results.

\begin{problem}\label{prob:140hom9prob5}
Suppose that a consumer group claims that the average price of gas in Ohio on a certain day was \$1.62, with standard deviation of 0.06.  Chris claims that the average price of gas in his zip code is the same as the state average.  Chris' friend, Mark, thinks that Chris' zip code has more expensive gas than the state as a whole.  Mark samples seven gas stations in Chris' zip code and finds the sample mean to be \$1.68.  Assume that gas prices are normally distributed and that the state standard deviation is the same as the standard deviation for Chris' zip code. Conduct a hypothesis test using a 0.05 level of significance to determine whether the average price in Chris' zip code really is higher than the average price in the state.

 \begin{problem}\label{prob:140hom9prob3}
Based on customer surveys, a local bakery knows that a certain cookie has an average rating of 8.2 (on a scale from 1 to 10), with a standard deviation of 1.05.  The bakery changes the recipe slightly and  surveys 60 customers to determine if the average rating has changed.  The sample mean rating is found to be 8.5. Assuming that the population standard deviation remains the same. Using a 5\% significance level can we conclude that the average rating has changed?

 \begin{problem}\label{prob:140hom9prob1}
Suppose that a national survey has found that the average amount of time that first-year college students spent preparing for classes in 2017 was 13.2 hours per week with a standard deviation of 2.1 hours.  A college dean wonders if the average class prep time for her first-year students is lower than the 2017 national average.  A random sample of 200 first-year students is selected and the mean class prep time is found to be 12.9 hours per week.  Perform a hypothesis test at a 5\% level of significance.

 \begin{problem}\label{prob:140hom9prob2}
A bakery claims that their signature cookie contains 250 grams of sugar.  An inspector is wondering if the amount of sugar in a cookie is greater than 250 grams.  He tests a random sample of 44 cookies for their sugar content.  The sample mean amount of sugar is found to be 255.3 grams of sugar per cookie, with sample standard deviation of 2.1 grams.  Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the average amount of sugar in a cookie exceeds 250 grams.  Use $\alpha=0.01$.

\begin{problem}\label{prob:140hom9prob6}
The average price for a gallon of unleaded gasoline in Columbus, OH on April 8, 2020 was \$1.655.  Suppose that I suspect that the mean gas price in my neighborhood is higher than the city average.  I randomly select six gas stations and find the following gas prices:
$$1.85,\quad 1.75, \quad 1.69,\quad 1.79,\quad 1.56,\quad 1.59$$
Conduct a hypothesis test using a 0.05 level of significance to determine if there is evidence that the mean gas price in my neighborhood is higher than the city average.  (You may assume that gas prices are approximately normally distributed.)

Use Google Sheets to find sample standard deviation.  Round standard deviation to four decimal places.
