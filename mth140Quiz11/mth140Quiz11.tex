\begin{problem}\label{prob:140quiz11prob1}
The average price for a gallon of unleaded gasoline in Columbus, OH on April 8, 2020 was \$1.655.  Suppose that I suspect that the mean gas price in my neighborhood is higher than the city average.  I randomly select six gas stations and find the following gas prices:
$$1.85,\quad 1.75, \quad 1.69,\quad 1.79,\quad 1.56,\quad 1.59$$
Conduct a hypothesis test using a 0.05 level of significance to determine if there is evidence that the mean gas price in my neighborhood is higher than the city average.  (You may assume that gas prices are approximately normally distributed.)

Null Hypothesis
$$H_0:\quad \mu=\answer{1.655}$$
Alternative Hypothesis
$$H_a:\quad \mu>\answer{1.655}$$

$$p=\answer[tolerance=0.01]{0.1655}$$
Decision:

\begin{multipleChoice} 
\choice{$p$-value is less than 0.05.  We reject the null hypothesis.}  
\choice{$p$-value is less than 0.05.  We do not reject the null hypothesis.} 
\choice{$p$-value is greater than 0.05.  We reject the null hypothesis.} 
\choice[correct]{$p$-value is greater than 0.05.  We do not reject the null hypothesis.}  
\end{multipleChoice}  

Conclusion:

\begin{multipleChoice} 
\choice{At the 0.05 level of significance, we have proved the null hypothesis.}  
\choice{At the 0.05 level of significance, there is not enough evidence to make any conclusions.} 
\choice{At the 0.05 level of significance, there is enough evidence to conclude that the mean gas price in my neighborhood is higher than the city average.}  
\choice[correct]{At the 0.05 level of significance, there is not enough evidence to conclude that the mean gas price in my neighborhood is higher than the city average.}

\begin{problem}\label{prob:140quiz11prob2}
Based on customer surveys, a local bakery knows that a certain cookie has an average rating of 8.2 (on a scale from 1 to 10), with a standard deviation of 1.05.  The bakery changes the recipe slightly and  surveys 60 customers to determine if the average rating has changed.  The sample mean rating is found to be 8.5. Assuming that the population standard deviation remains the same. Using a 5\% significance level can we conclude that the average rating has changed?

Null Hypothesis
$$H_0:\quad \mu=\answer{8.2}$$
