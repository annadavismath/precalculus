\begin{problem}\label{prob:140hom6prob5}
A machine that fills juice bottles at a factory is supposed to pour 24 fl.oz. into each bottle.  It is known from past experiments that the distribution of fill amounts is normal with a standard deviation of 0.21 fl.oz. A simple random sample of 9 bottles is tested and the sample mean amount is found to be 23.9 fl.oz.  Construct a 95\% confidence interval for the fill amount. 

Summary of given info:
$$\sigma=\answer{0.21}$$
$$\overline{x}=\answer{23.9}$$
$$n=\answer{9}$$
Use the Critical $z$-value table in your lecture notes to find $z_{\alpha/2}$
$$z_{\alpha/2}=\answer{1.96}$$
Error Bound for the Mean:
$$EBM=\answer{1.96}\frac{\answer{0.21}}{\answer{3}}=\answer{0.1372}$$
(Keep all significant digits in your calculator as you are doing the problem.  Enter your answer to 4 decimal places.)

The 95\% confidence interval is:
$$(\answer{23.7628},\answer{24.0372})$$

Assuming that 24 fl.oz. is the true mean for the fill amounts, how likely was the factory to get a sample of nine bottles with a mean of 23.9 fl.oz. or less?  Use GeoGebra to find your answer.  Enter your answer to four decimal points.

\begin{problem}\label{prob:140hom6prob4}
Suppose exam scores are normally distributed with an unknown population mean and a population standard deviation of 10 points. A random sample of 120 scores is taken and gives a sample mean of 72. Follow the indicated steps to find a 98\% confidence interval for the true (population) mean of exam scores.

Summary of given info:
$$\sigma=\answer{10}$$
$$\overline{x}=\answer{72}$$
$$n=\answer{120}$$
Use the Critical $z$-value table in your lecture notes to find $z_{\alpha/2}$
$$z_{\alpha/2}=\answer{2.33}$$
Error Bound for the Mean:
$$EBM=\answer{2.33}\frac{\answer{10}}{\answer[tolerance=0.01]{\sqrt{120}}}=\answer[tolerance=0.01]{2.127}$$
(Keep all significant digits in your calculator as you are doing the problem.  Round your answers to 3 decimal places.)

The 98\% confidence interval is:
$$(\answer[tolerance=0.05]{69.873},\answer[tolerance=0.05]{74.127})$$

 \begin{problem}\label{prob:140hom7prob1}
 A customer survey measured customer satisfaction with their dining experience on a scale from 1 (not satisfied) to 5 (very satisfied).  The survey was administered to 47 randomly selected customers.  The sample had a mean of 4.4 and standard deviation of 0.35.  
 
 Summarize the given information:
 $$n=\answer{47},\quad\overline{x}=\answer{4.4},\quad s=\answer{0.35},\quad df=\answer{46}$$
 
 Construct a 90\% confidence interval for the mean satisfaction rating.
 
  Use GeoGebra to find the the critical $t$-value.

$$t_{\alpha/2}=\answer{1.6787}$$
Error Bound for the Mean:
$$EBM=\answer{1.6787}\frac{\answer{0.35}}{\sqrt{\answer{47}}}=\answer{0.086}$$
(Keep all significant digits in your calculator as you are doing the problem.  Round your answer to 3 decimal places.)

The 90\% confidence interval is:
$$(\answer{4.314},\answer{4.486})$$

 \begin{problem}\label{prob:140hom7prob2}
 The following is a random sample of gas prices from 8 gas stations on the north-east side of Columbus. (October 11, 2020)
 $$1.95, 1.92, 1.99, 1.81, 1.86, 1.97, 1.99, 1.85$$
 Find the sample mean, sample standard deviation and degrees of freedom.  Round non-integer values to three decimal places.
 $$\overline{x}=\answer{1.918},\quad s=\answer{0.069},\quad df=\answer{7}$$
 
 Suppose that gas prices are approximately normally distributed.  Construct a 95\% confidence interval for the mean price of gasoline on the north-east side.
 
 Use GeoGebra to find the the critical $t$-value. 
 \begin{center}  
\geogebra{emwxhga2}{800}{600}  
\end{center}
$$t_{\alpha/2}=\answer{2.3646}$$
Error Bound for the Mean:
$$EBM=\answer{2.3646}\frac{\answer{0.069}}{\sqrt{\answer{8}}}=\answer{0.058}$$
(Keep all significant digits in your calculator as you are doing the problem.  Round your answer to 3 decimal places.)
