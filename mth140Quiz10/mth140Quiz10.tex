\begin{problem}\label{prob:140quiz10prob1}
Caleb wants to improve his long-jump.  His current mean length for the jump is 6.5 meters with a standard deviation of 0.35 meters.  Caleb adopts a new training routine.  To show that the new training routine was effective in increasing the length of his jumps, he measures 12 jumps. He finds that the average for the 12 jumps is 6.6 meters.  Assume normal distribution for jump lengths.  Conduct a hypothesis test using a 0.05 level of significance to determine if the training routine improved Caleb's results.
$$\sigma=\answer{0.35},\quad n=\answer{12},\quad \overline{x}=\answer{6.6}$$
Null Hypothesis
$$H_0:\quad \mu=\answer{6.5}$$
Alternative Hypothesis
$$H_a:\quad \mu>\answer{6.5}$$
Find the $z$-score
$$z=\frac{\answer{6.6}-\answer{6.5}}{\answer{0.35}/\answer[tolerance=0.01]{\sqrt{12}}}=\answer[tolerance=0.001]{0.9897}$$

$$p=\answer[tolerance=0.01]{0.1612}$$
Decision:

\begin{multipleChoice} 
\choice{$p$-value is less than 0.05.  We reject the null hypothesis.}  
\choice{$p$-value is less than 0.05.  We do not reject the null hypothesis.} 
\choice{$p$-value is greater than 0.05.  We reject the null hypothesis.} 
\choice[correct]{$p$-value is greater than 0.05.  We do not reject the null hypothesis.}  
\end{multipleChoice}  

Conclusion:

\begin{multipleChoice} 
\choice{At the 0.05 level of significance, we have proved the null hypothesis.}  
\choice{At the 0.05 level of significance, there is not enough evidence to make any conclusions.} 
\choice{At the 0.05 level of significance, there is enough evidence to conclude that Caleb's jump has improved.}  
\choice[correct]{At the 0.05 level of significance, there is not enough evidence to conclude that Caleb's jump has improved.}

\begin{problem}\label{prob:140quiz10prob2}
Suppose that a consumer group claims that the average price of gas in Ohio on a certain day was \$1.62, with standard deviation of 0.06.  Chris claims that the average price of gas in his zip code is the same as the state average.  Chris' friend, Mark, thinks that Chris' zip code has more expensive gas than the state as a whole.  Mark samples seven gas stations in Chris' zip code and finds the sample mean to be \$1.68.  Assume that gas prices are normally distributed and that the state standard deviation is the same as the standard deviation for Chris' zip code. Conduct a hypothesis test using a 0.05 level of significance to determine whether the average price in Chris' zip code really is higher than the average price in the state.
$$\sigma=\answer{0.06},\quad n=\answer{7},\quad \overline{x}=\answer{1.68}$$
Null Hypothesis
$$H_0:\quad \mu=\answer{1.62}$$
Alternative Hypothesis
$$H_a:\quad \mu>\answer{1.62}$$
Find the $z$-score
$$z=\frac{\answer{1.68}-\answer{1.62}}{\answer{0.06}/\answer[tolerance=0.01]{\sqrt{7}}}=\answer[tolerance=0.004]{2.65}$$
