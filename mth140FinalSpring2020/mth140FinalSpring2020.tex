\begin{problem}\label{prob:140finalprob2}
A real estate agent finds the following regression line for predicting the price of a house ($y$), in thousands of dollars, from the square footage ($x$).

$$y = 160.2 + 0.09x$$

Based on this model, the price of a 2,300 sq. foot house will be $\answer{367.2}$ thousand dollars.

\begin{problem}\label{prob:140finalprob3}
Alice (A), Ben (B), Catherine (C) and Doug (D) took the same biology test.  Their results are listed below: 

Alice's score is in the $90$th percentile 

Ben's $z$-score is $z = 2$ 

Catherine's score is in the $10$th percentile 

Doug's $z$-score is $z = 0$

Arrange students’ initials (A, B, C and D) in order of increasing test results (lowest test result to highest test result).  Enter your answer as a single string, all capitals, no spaces.  e.g. ABCD.
$$\answer[format=string]{CDAB}$$

\begin{problem}\label{prob:140finalprob4}
A sample of size $40$ is drawn from a population whose standard deviation is $10.4$.  The sample mean is $74.5$.  Construct a 99\% confidence interval.

Summary of given info:
$$\sigma=\answer{10.4}$$
$$\overline{x}=\answer{74.5}$$
$$n=\answer{40}$$
Use the Critical $z$-value table to find $z_{\alpha/2}$
$$z_{\alpha/2}=\answer{2.575}$$
Error Bound for the Mean:
$$EBM=\answer{2.575}\frac{\answer{10.4}}{\answer[tolerance=0.01]{\sqrt{40}}}=\answer[tolerance=0.01]{4.2343}$$
The 99\% confidence interval is:
$$(\answer[tolerance=0.1]{70.27},\answer[tolerance=0.1]{78.73})$$

\begin{problem}\label{prob:140finalprob8}
An ice-cream shop claims that one scoop of ice-cream is 50 grams.  You may assume that ice-cream amounts per scoop are normally distributed.  An inspector is wondering if the amount of ice-cream in one scoop is less than 50 grams.  He tests a random sample of 60 scoops.  The sample mean is found to be 49.2 grams, with sample standard deviation of 2.2 grams.  Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the average amount of ice-cream in one scoop is less than 50 grams.  Use $\alpha=0.05$.

$$\overline{x}=\answer{49.2},\quad s=\answer{2.2},\quad n=\answer{60},\quad df=\answer{59}$$
Null Hypothesis
$$H_0:\quad \mu=\answer{50}$$
Alternative Hypothesis
$$H_a:\quad \mu<\answer{50}$$

\geogebra{emwxhga2}{800}{600}  
\end{center}
$$p=\answer[tolerance=0.001]{0.0033}$$
Decision:

\begin{multipleChoice} 
\choice[correct]{$p$-value is less than 0.05.  We reject the null hypothesis.}  
\choice{$p$-value is less than 0.05.  We do not reject the null hypothesis.} 
\choice{$p$-value is greater than 0.05.  We reject the null hypothesis.} 
\choice{$p$-value is greater than 0.05.  We do not reject the null hypothesis.}  
\end{multipleChoice}  

Conclusion:

\begin{multipleChoice} 
\choice{At the 0.05 level of significance, we have proved the null hypothesis.}  
\choice{At the 0.05 level of significance, there is not enough evidence to make any conclusions.} 
\choice[correct]{At the 0.05 level of significance, there is enough evidence to conclude that the mean amount of ice-cream per scoop is less than 50 grams.}  
\choice{At the 0.05 level of significance, there is not enough evidence to conclude that the mean amount of ice-cream per scoop is less than 50 grams.}
