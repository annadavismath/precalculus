\begin{problem}\label{prob:mth240exam2prob2}
An island is located 1000 feet away from a coastal highway.  A car traveling at 88 ft/sec is approaching point $A$, as shown in the diagram.  How fast is the distance between the car and the island changing when the car is 800 feet away from point $A$?

\end{image}

Given rate: $\frac{dx}{dt}=\answer{-88}$.

Find rate:  $\frac{dy}{dt}$

Relationship between $\answer{x}$ and $\answer{y}$:

$$\answer{x^2}+1000^2=\answer{y^2}$$

When $x=800$, $y=\answer[tolerance=1]{1280.62}$.

The distance between the car and the island is changing at the rate of $\answer[tolerance=1]{-55}$ feet per second.

Use linearization to estimate $\sqrt{10}$.

The function I will use is:
$$f(x)=\answer{\sqrt{x}}$$

The derivative of the function is:
$$f'(x)=\answer{0.5x^{-0.5}}$$

Next, I need to find the tangent line to the graph of $f$ at $x=\answer{9}$.

The slope of the tangent line is (enter exact fraction; no decimals) $\answer{\frac{1}{6}}$.
