\begin{problem}\label{prob:exam3prob1}
Suppose that a national survey has found that the average amount of time that first-year college students spent preparing for class in 2017 was 13.2 hours per week with a standard deviation of 2.1 hours.  A college dean wonders if the average class prep time for her first-year students differs from the 2017 national average.  A random sample of 200 first-year students is selected and the mean class prep time is found to be 12.9 hours per week.  Perform a hypothesis test at a 5\% level of significance.

\begin{problem}\label{prob:exam3prob2}
Construct a 90\% confidence interval for the population mean if the population standard deviation is known to be 8.5, and a simple random sample of size 180 had the mean 122.4.

Summary of given info:
$$\sigma=\answer{8.5}$$
$$\overline{x}=\answer{122.4}$$
$$n=\answer{180}$$
Use the Critical $z$-value table to find $z_{\alpha/2}$
$$z_{\alpha/2}=\answer{1.645}$$
Error Bound for the Mean:
$$EBM=\answer{1.645}\frac{\answer{8.5}}{\answer[tolerance=0.01]{\sqrt{180}}}=\answer[tolerance=0.01]{1.042}$$

\begin{problem}\label{prob:exam3prob3}
Mean entry-level salaries for college graduates with mechanical engineering degrees and electrical engineering degrees are believed to be approximately the same. A recruiting office thinks that the mean mechanical engineering salary is
actually lower than the mean electrical engineering salary. The recruiting office randomly surveys 50 entry level mechanical
engineers and 60 entry level electrical engineers. Their mean salaries were \$46,100 and \$46,700, respectively. Their
standard deviations were \$3,450 and \$4,210, respectively. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if you agree that the mean
entry-level mechanical engineering salary is lower than the mean entry-level electrical engineering salary. (Use 0.05 confidence level.)

A hospital is trying to cut down on emergency room wait times. It is interested in the amount of time patients must wait before being called back to be examined.

\begin{problem}\label{prob:exam3prob5}
A bakery claims that their signature cookie contains 250 grams of sugar.  An inspector is wondering if the amount of sugar in a cookie is greater than 250 grams.  He tests a random sample of 44 cookies for their sugar content.  The sample mean amount of sugar is found to be 255.3 grams of sugar per cookie, with sample standard deviation of 2.1 grams.  Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the average amount of sugar in a cookie exceeds 250 grams.  Use $\alpha=0.01$.
