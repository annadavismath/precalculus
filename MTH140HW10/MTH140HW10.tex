 \begin{problem}\label{prob:140hom9prob1}
Suppose a student advocacy group is trying to determine whether there is a difference between the average textbook cost for college freshmen and college seniors.  The group surveys eight randomly selected freshmen and eleven seniors.  The results are listed below.  Perform hypothesis testing at 0.05 level of significance. (You may assume that textbook costs are approximately normally distributed.)

Freshmen: \$155, \$280, \$98, \$163, \$178, \$210, \$173, \$169

Seniors: \$145, \$180, \$197, \$238, \$215, \$110, \$153, \$116, \$203, \$54, \$105  

Summarize the information for college freshmen.

 \begin{problem}\label{prob:140hom9prob2}
 Suppose a consumer advocacy group believes that brand $B$ tires last longer than brand $A$ tires.  The group surveys ten randomly selected tire owners for each of the two brands.  The longevity results (in thousands of miles) are listed below.  Suppose the standard deviation for longevity for brand $A$ is known to be $7500$ miles, and the standard deviation for brand $B$ is known to be $8100$.  Perform hypothesis testing at 0.05 level of significance. (You may assume that tire longevity is approximately normally distributed.)

Brand $A$ (in thousands of miles): $$61.5,\quad 59.3,\quad 52.8,\quad 64.1,\quad 60.4,\quad 51.4,\quad 61.3,\quad 67.8,\quad 55.7,\quad 61.1$$

Brand $B$ (in thousands of miles): $$60.3,\quad 60.1, \quad 56.7,\quad 69.5, \quad 67.4,\quad 57.1,\quad 69.8,\quad 62.4,\quad 57.4,\quad 68.1$$

 \begin{problem}
 A study was conducted to investigate how effective a new diet was in lowering cholesterol. Results for the
randomly selected subjects are shown in the table ("Before" and "After" results for the same subject are matched; subjects are numbered 1 through 9). The differences have a normal distribution. Are the subjectsâ€™
cholesterol levels lower on average after the diet? Test at the 5\% level.
