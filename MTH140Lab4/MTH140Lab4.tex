For each indicated scatter plot, enter the linear regression equation (keep all digits from the spreadsheet), $R^2$ (keep all digits from the spreadsheet), and the computed correlation coefficient, $r$ (rounded to two decimal places).

\begin{problem}\label{prob:140lab4prob1}
Grade 3-5 grade-level read \% $(y)$ versus Family involvement $(x)$.

Linear regression equation: $y=\answer{0.615}x+\answer{3.36}$

$R^2=\answer{0.369}$

$r=\answer{0.61}$
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}\label{prob:140lab4prob2}
Grade 3-5 grade-level read \% $(y)$ versus Instruction score $(x)$.

Linear regression equation: $y=\answer{0.324}x+\answer{17.9}$

$R^2=\answer{0.081}$

$r=\answer{0.28}$
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}\label{prob:140lab4prob3}
Grade 6-8 grade-level math \% $(y)$ versus Grade 3-5 grade-level math \% $(x)$.

Linear regression equation: $y=\answer{0.809}x+\answer{12.8}$

$R^2=\answer{0.688}$

$r=\answer{0.83}$
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}\label{prob:140lab4prob4}
Grade 6-8 grade-level read \% $(y)$ versus Grade 3-5 grade-level read \% $(x)$.

Linear regression equation: $y=\answer{0.9}x+\answer{9.62}$

$R^2=\answer{0.864}$

$r=\answer{0.93}$

This correlation is particularly strong.  Use your linear regression model to predict the percentage of students in grades 6-8 who read at or above grade level for a school where 85\% of students in grades 3-5 read at or above grade level.  (Round to two decimal places.)
